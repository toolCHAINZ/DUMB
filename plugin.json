   "longdescription": "![DUMB logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolCHAINZ/DUMB/master/dumb.svg?sanitize=true =400x800)\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple architecture (and executable format) made for the purpose of teaching how to write Binja loaders and architectures.\r\n\r\nMy hope for this repo is that it can be a simple teaching resource for this topic. While it covers the basics, it leaves some important topics (like flags) uncovered. PRs welcome!\r\n\r\nAn example \"firmware image\" is included [here](https://github.com/toolCHAINZ/DUMB/blob/master/test.bin)\r\n\r\n# DUMB Architecture\r\n\r\nFollowing is a description of the architecture. In this document, we use the following format to specify bitfields:\r\n\r\n`0:xxyy` represents a single byte: `0` means that the first (upper) nibble of the byte is zero, while `xxyy` indicates two 2-bit fields making up the lower nibble of the byte.\r\n\r\n## Registers\r\n\r\n* `sp` (stack pointer)\r\n* `r0` (GPR)\r\n* `r1` (GPR)\r\n* `r2` (GPR)\r\n* `r3` (GPR)\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n### One Byte Instructions\r\n\r\n| Format   | Tokenization  | Meaning                                                              |\r\n| -------- | ------------  | ------------------------------------                                 |\r\n| `0:xxyy` | `mov rx ry`   | Move the value in `ry` into `rx`                                     |\r\n| `1:xxyy` | `add rx ry`   | Add the values of `ry` and `rx` and store the result in `rx`         |\r\n| `2:xxyy` | `and rx ry`   | And the values of `ry` and `rx` and store the result in `rx`         |\r\n| `3:xxyy` | `or rx ry`    | Or the values of `ry` and `rx` and store the result in `rx`          |\r\n| `4:xxyy` | `xor rx ry`   | Xor the values of `ry` and `rx` and store the result in `rx`         |\r\n| `9:____` | `ret`         | Return from the current function to the address stored on the stack. |\r\n\r\n### Five Byte Instructions\r\n| Format               |  Tokenization          |   Meaning                                                                        |\r\n| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `a0 XX XX XX XX`     | `call XXXXXXXXX`       | Push `addr + 5` onto the stack and transfer execution to `XXXXXXXX` (little endian dword) |\r\n| `7:xxyy XX XX XX XX` | `jlt rx, ry, XXXXXXXX` | If `rx` is less than `ry`, jump to `XXXXXXXX`, otherwise continue to next instr  |\r\n| `8:__rr XX XX XX XX` | `mov rr, XXXXXXXX`     | Move the immediate `XXXXXXXX` into `rr`                                          |\r\n\r\n# DUMB Format\r\n\r\nDUMB files are extremely simple, containing only magic, and metadata for a single section. The format is as follows:\r\n\r\n| Offset | Length | Contents (if applicable) | Description                                                |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------              |\r\n| 0      | 4      | \"`DUMB`\"                 | Magic                                                      |\r\n| 4      | 4      |          N/A             | Section length stored as little endian dword               |\r\n| 8      | 4      |            N/A           | Address to load section at, stored as little endian dword  |\r\n\r\n",
